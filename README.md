This project uses Flask, Bootstrap, Jinja2, sqlalchemy, and werkzeug.

The problem I intended to solve was a way to track my protein intake throught the day to keep up with my goal. 
In my app you can add protein for the day and it will add it to the existing amount. It will then compare it to the goal that you can set and tell you how much protein you still need to consume and what percent you are relative to your goal. 
It also allows for users and all data tied to that user will only be able to be accessed by them.
